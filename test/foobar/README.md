# foobar test package

This is a test case for `haskell-stack-builder`.

It exercises the essentials, all at once:

 - building Haskell code at all (obviously)
 - building package with dependencies from Stackage
 - building package with external-deps from Hackage
 - building modules that use libraries in TH (TemplateHaskell)
